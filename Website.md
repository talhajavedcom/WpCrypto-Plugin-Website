**Q: Do I need a crypto exchange account?**

**Q: What cryptocurrencies are supported?**
A: BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT (ERC20, BEP20, TRC20), and you can add any custom token.

**Q: Do I need coding skills?**
A: No. Simple point-and-click configuration in WordPress admin.

**Q: What if API limits are reached? (Pro)**
A: The plugin automatically falls back to manual mode. You can still verify payments manually.

**Q: Can I upgrade from Manual to Pro later?**
A: Yes! Contact us for upgrade pricing (usually difference + small fee).

**Q: Is this legal and compliant?**
A: Yes. You're accepting direct payments, not providing payment processing services. Check local regulations.

**Q: Do customers need crypto experience?**
A: Basic knowledge helps. The payment page shows clear instructions, QR codes, and copy buttons.

**Q: What about refunds?**
A: Crypto transactions are final. Handle refunds by sending crypto back to customer manually.
